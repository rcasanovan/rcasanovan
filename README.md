### Hello there 👋

I'm Ricardo - a Computer Science Engineer and a Staff iOS Developer.

I've been creating iOS apps since 2010 and I have a strong experience working with Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit and Objective C, RESTful APIs, architectural paterns like TCA, VIPER, MVVM and best software development practices.

## My values
🦾 Trust on myself and my actions.

🤝 Not only one person has the solution to the problem. There are many ways to reach the solution.

🚀 Working as a team is much more than sharing your day with your colleagues. It's to understand that we're all in the same ship with the same direction.
