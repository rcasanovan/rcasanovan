### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I've been creating iOS apps since 2010. I have a strong experience working with Swift and Objective C, RESTful APIs, architectural paterns like VIPER, MVVM and best practices. During all these years I have worked with different version control tools such as GitHub or Bitbucket and with pull requests and code review. Working with Jira and another Agile tools is part of my day to day.
