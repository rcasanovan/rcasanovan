## Hello mates! I’m looking for my next professional challenge 🍏.

I have 12-14 years of experience developing native apps for iOS with UIKit / SwiftUI as well as the use of different architectures (VIPER, MVVM or TCA).

I live in Valencia, Spain, so I'm open to work remotely for any amazing projects around the world!.

If you are looking for a staff in the iOS area or if you know about a project to change people's lives, you know where I am! ✌🏻.

### Hello there 👋

I'm Ricardo - a Computer Science Engineer and a Staff iOS Developer.

I've been creating iOS apps since 2010 and I have a strong experience working with Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit and Objective C, RESTful APIs, architectural paterns like TCA, VIPER, MVVM and best software development practices.

## My values
🦾 Trust on myself and my actions.

🤝 Not only one person has the solution to the problem. There are many ways to reach the solution.

🚀 Working as a team is much more than sharing your day with your colleagues. It's to understand that we're all in the same ship with the same direction.
